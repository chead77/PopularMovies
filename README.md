# PopularMovies
Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree course project 2 (stage 1) & project 3 (stage 2)

This application displays a scrollable list of movie posters that is populated with data from a call to the TMDB API. Tapping on a poster opens a details page, where the movie can be marked as a favorite, and the user can view trailers and reviews for the movie. The main movie list can be updated via setting to sort by popularity, rating, and favorites.

Any retrofit call to the TMDB API uses the string constant PopularMoviesConstants.API_KEY. This key
is stored in a file that will not be included in the Github repository. To use this project, a new
API key will need to be obtained from https://www.themoviedb.org/account/signup, and the appropriate
constant will need to be created in your local project.
