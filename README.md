# PopularMovies
Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree course project 2, stages 1 & 2

The master branch is currently completed to the end of stage 1

Stage 2 is in its own feature branch.

Any retrofit call to the TMDB API uses the string constant PopularMoviesConstants.API_KEY. This key
is stored in a file that will not be included in the Github repository. To use this project, a new
API key will need to be obtained from https://www.themoviedb.org/account/signup, and the appropriate
constant will need to be created in your local project.
